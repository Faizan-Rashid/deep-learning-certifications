| **Module** | **Topics Covered** | **Applications / Why It Matters** |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Basics of Vectors & Matrices** | - Definition of vectors and matrices  <br> - Creation and representation in Python  <br> - Understanding dimensions and shapes | Foundation of ML data representation. Every dataset can be thought of as a combination of vectors or a single large matrix. |
| **Basic Vector Operations** | - Vector addition and scalar multiplication <br> - Linear combinations and magnitude | Used to manipulate feature vectors, normalize data, and understand relationships in feature space. |
| **Basic Matrix Operations** | - Matrix addition, subtraction, and scalar operations <br> - Matrix transposition | Enables you to manipulate multi-dimensional data, transform coordinates, and preprocess datasets. |
| **Dot Product & Matrix Multiplication** | - Dot product between vectors <br> - Matrix Ã— vector and matrix Ã— matrix operations <br> - Compatibility checks for multiplication | Powers most ML algorithms â€” from linear regression and gradient computation to deep neural network layers. |
| **Determinant & Linear Dependency** | - Determinant computation <br> - Meaning of zero determinant <br> - Detecting linear dependency between vectors | Helps determine if a system of linear equations is solvable, and understand rank and independence â€” key for optimization and dimensionality reduction. |
